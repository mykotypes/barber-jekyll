            <p>Designing and building sites takes some resources as always. Here are few things that I am mostly focused right now</p>
            <ul>
              <li>User experience project, which besides the research and finding best suited the visual language, there's some valuable learning in necessary tools (adobe XD) </li>
              <li>Wordpress based bloging platform with user generated content. </li>
            </ul>
